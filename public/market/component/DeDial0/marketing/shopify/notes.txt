App introduction: Animated, single value, counter for situations when a circular dial display is required.

App details: DeDial is a simple User Interface component whose primary purpose is to draw a circular but digital dial. It's "digital" because individual "ticks" are drawn for each possible dial position, rather than a continuous circle. These types of dials can be used to represent circular gauges, or the ticks on a clock dial, or segments of a targeting sight. Additionally an animated countdown can be initiated to add a more dynamic feel to any store.

Feature 1: Render varied circular dials for static or animated displays, and clock faces.
Feature 2: Animated forward and reverse counter with optional JavaScript interface.
Feature 3: Supports CSS directly from the theme editor for endless customisation options.
