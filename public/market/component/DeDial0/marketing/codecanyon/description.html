    DeDial is a simple User Interface component whose primary purpose is to draw a circular 
    but digital dial. It's "digital" because individual "ticks" are drawn for each possible 
    dial position, rather than a continuous circle.
  </p>
  <p>
    These types of dials can be used to represent circular gauges, or the ticks on a clock 
    dial, or segments of a targeting sight. The uses are ultimately up to your imagination.
  </p>
  <p>
    DeDial can also be used as a single value counter. This is handy when you want to display
    an animated count of customers, orders, or cashflow, for example. Please note that, whilst
    this component can be used to build clock functionality, it does not include time-based
    counting as it is.

  <h1 style="font-family:Arial">Basic Usage</h1>
  <p>
    Usage is as easy as including the component file and an optional stylesheet.
    There are no other dependencies or files required. From there you can start
    placing DeDial tags anywhere in your HTML.
